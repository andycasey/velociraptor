\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\begin{itemize}
\item the binary fraciton is important
\item Gaia provides exquisite astrometry and RV measurements over many years
\item The errors in these quantities are well-characterised
\item When a star is in a binary system (or triary, etc), there will be excess scatter relative to a single star of the primary's properties
\item the excess RV noise (and in DR1 or DR3, excess astrometric noise) can be used to infer the presence of a companion
\end{itemize}


\section{Model}

% The effect of binaries.

% RV noise vs astrometric excess noise.

% When would we expect to see astrometric noise and not RV noise, and vice-versa? in what situations?

% Here we base our model using RV data only from Gaia DR2.

% Some fraction of stars in Gaia are single star systems (or have such low semi-amplitudes that would not be detected by Gaia), and we will use those stars (within a mixture model) to calibrate the radial velocity error floor

% We will do this on individual epoch measurements

% ASSUMPTIONS

% MODEL

% CALIBRATION SAMPLE (including ADQL query)

% Fitting the model:

% Comparisons of residuals with other stellar properties.

% What is the RV error that Gaia can measure in a single epoch for a given magnitude vs colour, etc. 

% What are the distributions of orbital parameters of binary systems that we would be able to detect?

% Calculating a probability of binarity for every star, taking the non-measurements into account!

% Completeness cuts,.... selection effects?

\section{Results}

% Binary fraction in the spaces that we were fitting: rp flux, colour, etc, just showing the transition of  probabilities

% Binary fraction as a function of fitting properties, and other stellar properties from Gaia

% Binarity across the H-R diagram

% Binarity with metallicity 

% Binarity at height above the plane?

% Binarity in clusters vs the plane?
